# Frontend Frontier: CPlusPlus.com UI Redesign

## Project Overview

Frontend Frontier is a front-end redesign project for [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/), a widely-used resource for C++ programming. This project focuses on delivering a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for the following key pages:
- **Front Page**: The main landing page with an overview of the site.
- **References**: A section dedicated to C++ language references and documentation.
- **Structure of a Program**: A page explaining the basic structure of a C++ program.
- **Articles**: A collection of educational articles on C++ topics.
- **Forums Page**: A community discussion hub for C++ developers.

The aim is to enhance the visual appeal and usability of these pages while maintaining the educational focus of the original site. The live demo is hosted at [Frontend Frontier](https://frontend-frontier-r4a9vp2yc-dragonite8125-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/), and the source code is available on GitHub at [Frontend-Frontier Repository](https://github.com/OMPRABHU8125/Frontend-Frontier.git).
